An e-Commerce website built for my second year CS module, Internet Applications Programming. 
It was created using ASP.Net Core 5 with C#, HTML and CSS.

The program features a robust and professional e-commmerce website with a minimalistic user interface for selling Apple products. 
It uses the ASP.NET 5 and Microsoft Entity Framework for it's own database. 
Featuring an index page listing all the products with a fast search functionality.

Users will be able to create an account with a valid email account, for which they can update theur password or user details.
Users can add items to the shopping cart, which will remain saved using the database in Entitiy Framework Core.

The website also features an admin functionnality where the admin will be able to delete, assign roles or remove roles from users.
The admin, when logged in will have additional pages available from the navigation bar from which they will be able to add, delete or update products

Login details for the admin:
username: admin@adminmanager.com
password: admin123!
